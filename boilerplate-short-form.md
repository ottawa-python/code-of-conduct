# Ottawa Python Authors Group(opag) Code of Conduct

## Short form boilerplate for when the entire Code of Conduct is too much text

### Tiny length (e.g. for emails/press releases)

Ottawa Python is dedicated to creating a welcoming experience for everyone.
Our code of conduct can be found at: https://github.com/ottawa-python/code-of-conduct
and you can contact the Ottawa Python Code of Conduct Committee at
opag.conduct@gmail.com.

### Medium length (e.g. for brochures and flyers)

*note: prefer the tiny reference above except on printed material where
 hyperlinks are not useful*

The Ottawa Python Authors Group(OPAG) community is made up of active members
from the Ottawa/Gatineau area. Each member brings with them a unique set of skills,
personality, and experiences; it is through the diversity of our community
that OPAG experiences great successes and continued growth.

We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an
environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.
Accordingly, we expect all attendees to show respect and courtesy to other
attendees at all OPAG events.

All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any
OPAG event must conform to our Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce
this code throughout our events.

**Our full code of conduct can be found at:**
https://github.com/ottawa-python/code-of-conduct

**Here is the short version:**

- All communication should remain appropriate for a professional audience
  including people of many different backgrounds.
- When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
- We consider sexual language or imagery inappropriate in any venue
  including talks.
- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.
- Behave professionally. We consider harassment and sexist, racist,
  or exclusionary jokes inappropriate.

OPAG organizers may ask any attendees violating these rules to leave the event.
Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly environment for all.

**Contact information:**

If you feel harassed, witness harassment, or have other concerns,
please contact a member of the OPAG Code of Conduct Committee
(opag.conduct@gmail.com).  If you consider the matter especially
urgent, please talk to the organizer on duty right away â€”
they will be introduced at the beginning of each event.

Or if you feel uncomfortable speaking in person, you can make an
anonymous report to opag.conduct@gmail.com at a time that is
convenient.

An OPAG organizer or representative can help participants contact security
or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
experiencing harassment to feel safe during the event.
We value your attendance.
